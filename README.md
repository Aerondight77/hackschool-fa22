# Finance Buddy Project

This is a project made in ACM UC San Diego's Hackschool Workshop where we learned about full stack development.

The project itself is a purchase tracker. Its intended purpose is to help users keep track of their purchases, such as:

*Name of product purchased.
*Cost of product.
*Method of payment used to purchase product.
*Description of the product purchased.
*Location of where the product was purchased.
*Date of when the product was purchased.

Tools used in this project include: Visual Studio Code, Node.js, MongoDB, and React.
